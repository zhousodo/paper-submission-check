```

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Check

Before starting, determine these properties (they affect later phases):

### 1. Detect Citation Style

Search for `\bibliographystyle{}`:

| Style | Type | Citation Appearance | Sentence-Start Rule |
|-------|------|--------------------|--------------------|
| `elsarticle-num`, `IEEEtran`, `unsrt`, `plain` | **Numbered** | [1], [2] | Use `Author et al.~\cite{key}` or `The work in~\cite{key}` |
| `elsarticle-harv`, `apalike`, `natbib` | **Author-Year** | (Smith, 2024) | Can start with `\citet{key}` directly |

**CRITICAL for numbered style**: Do NOT write `the work of Author et al.~\cite{key}, who...` — this creates redundancy. Use one of:
- `Author et al.~\cite{key} proposed...` (author + number)
- `The work in~\cite{key} proposed...` (work-in-number reference)
- `In~\cite{key}, the authors proposed...` (in-number format)

### 2. Count Authors

Search for `\author{}`:
- **Single author**: "we/our" should be avoided, use passive or "this paper"
- **Two+ authors**: "we/our" is acceptable but should be used sparingly (see Phase 1 thresholds)

### 3. Identify Template & Journal

Search for `\documentclass{}` and `\journal{}`:
- Check if `\journal{}` still contains a **template default** value (e.g., "Nuclear Physics B" in elsarticle template — must be changed)
- Verify the document class matches the target journal

---

## Phase 1: Pronoun & Subjectivity Check

### Quantitative Thresholds

Count total occurrences of `\bwe\b` and `\bour\b` (excluding comments and code):

| Pronoun | Recommended Max (full paper) | Action if exceeded |
|---------|-----------------------------|--------------------|
| "we" | ≤15 | Replace excess with passive voice or "this paper" |
| "our" | ≤8 | Replace with "the proposed" / "the" |
| "us" | ≤3 | Replace with passive constructions |

### Section-Specific Rules

| Section | "we/our" Guidance |
|---------|-------------------|
| Abstract | Max 1-2; prefer "this paper proposes" |
| Introduction | Max 2-3 for contributions; "This paper proposes..." preferred for opening |
| Contributions list | "We propose..." is standard and acceptable |
| Method | Keep for formula derivations ("we compute..."); replace elsewhere with passive |
| Experiments | Prefer passive: "Experiments were conducted..." |
| Results/Discussion | Replace "our method" → "the proposed method" or method name |
| Conclusion | Prefer "This paper proposed..." or passive |
| Future Work | "we" is acceptable for describing future plans |

### The "our proposed X" Rule

**"our proposed X" is always redundant** — either "our X" or "the proposed X", never both. Search for and replace:

```
our proposed method   → the proposed method
our proposed approach → the proposed approach  
our proposed algorithm → the proposed algorithm
```

### Subjective Language (always replace)

| Subjective | Objective |
|------------|-----------|
| We believe that X | The results indicate X |
| In our opinion | Based on the experimental evidence |
| We feel this is important | This is significant because |
| Our method is the best | The proposed method outperforms |

---

## Phase 2: AI-Generated Style Detection & Removal

**This is the most critical phase.** Journal editors and reviewers increasingly detect AI-generated text. Major publishers (Elsevier, Springer Nature, IEEE) require disclosure of AI use, and undisclosed AI-generated text can lead to desk rejection or ethics investigation.

This phase has two parts: **Detection** (find AI patterns) and **Removal** (rewrite to sound human).

### Step 2a: Detect AI Patterns by Severity

Scan for patterns in order of severity (S1 = desk rejection risk, S2 = major revision risk):

**S1 — Desk Rejection Risk (fix every instance):**

| Pattern | What to Search | Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Em dash overuse | `—` or `---` | ≤3 total, 0 in abstract |
| 21 focal words | `delve`, `tapestry`, `landscape` (figurative), `nuanced`, `multifaceted`, `intricate`, `meticulous`, `pivotal`, `underscore`, `commendable` | 0 instances |
| Participial -ing chains | `, highlighting`, `, underscoring`, `, demonstrating`, `, showcasing`, `, reflecting`, `, contributing`, `, ensuring`, `, fostering` | ≤3 total |
| Tier-1 AI phrases | `garnered attention`, `pave the way`, `testament to`, `realm of`, `myriad of`, `plethora of`, `poised to revolutionize` | 0 instances |

**S2 — Major Revision Risk (fix all instances):**

| Pattern | What to Search | Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Negative parallelism | `not only...but also`, `not just...but`, `goes beyond...to` | ≤1 total |
| Rule of Three | Three abstract adjectives joined by "and" (e.g., "accuracy, efficiency, and robustness") | Replace with data |
| Inflated significance | `pivotal`, `crucial`, `vital`, `watershed`, `groundbreaking`, `transformative`, `paradigm shift` | Replace with specifics |
| Vague attributions | `researchers have shown`, `studies indicate`, `experts argue`, `it is widely recognized` | Replace with citations |
| Positivity bias | Missing limitations section, no failure cases discussed | Add honest limitations |

**S3 — Minor Revision (fix most):**

| Pattern | What to Search | Threshold |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Nominalizations | `utilization`, `implementation`, `optimization`, `facilitation` | Convert to verbs |
| Conjunctive saturation | `Furthermore`, `Moreover`, `Additionally` starting consecutive paragraphs | ≤3 each total |
| Formulaic transitions | "Having discussed X, we now turn to Y" | 0 instances |
| Correlative conjunctions | `whether...or`, `both...and`, `neither...nor` | ≤2 total |
| Hedge stacking | "could potentially suggest that it might" | ≤1 hedge per sentence |

### Step 2b: Rewrite with Human Style

Apply these golden rules when rewriting:

1. **Specific beats impressive**: Replace every adjective with a number
2. **Active beats nominal**: "X uses Y" not "the utilization of Y by X"
3. **Short beats long**: If a sentence has >30 words, split it
4. **Direct beats hedged**: "X improves Y" not "X could potentially improve Y"
5. **Cited beats claimed**: "Smith et al. showed X" not "researchers have shown X"
6. **Honest beats promotional**: Include real limitations, not vague future work
7. **Varied beats formulaic**: Don't start every paragraph with "Furthermore"
8. **Simple beats ornate**: "use" not "utilize", "show" not "underscore"

### Quick Before/After Reference

| AI-Generated | Human-Written |
|-------------|---------------|
| "This paper delves into the intricate challenges of anomaly detection" | "This paper addresses anomaly detection in streaming graphs" |
| "The method — leveraging sketch structures — achieves remarkable performance across diverse datasets" | "The method uses sketch structures and achieves 0.998 AUC on CICIDS2019" |
| "These findings not only validate the effectiveness but also underscore the potential, demonstrating superior adaptability" | "The method outperforms all baselines on three of four datasets (Table 3)" |
| "Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation demonstrates both efficiency and robustness" | "The method processes 1M edges in 12 seconds with constant memory" |

## Phase 3: Symbol & Punctuation Errors

### Mixed Chinese/English Punctuation (Critical for CJK authors)

Search for Chinese characters in English text:

| Chinese | English Correct | Search Pattern |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| （ ） | ( ) | `\uff08`, `\uff09` |
| ， | , | `\uff0c` |
| 。 | . | `\u3002` |
| ； | ; | `\uff1b` |
| ： | : | `\uff1a` |
| " " | " " or `` '' (LaTeX) | `\u201c`, `\u201d` |
| ' ' | ' ' or ` ' (LaTeX) | `\u2018`, `\u2019` |
| 、 | , | `\u3001` |
| — | --- (LaTeX em-dash) | `\u2014` |

**All Chinese punctuation in English papers is an error. Zero tolerance.**

### Dash Errors in LaTeX

| Usage | Correct LaTeX | Wrong |
|-------|--------------|-------|
| Hyphen (compound words) | `-` | |
| En-dash (number ranges) | `--` (e.g., pages 1--10) | `-` for ranges |
| Em-dash (parenthetical) | `---` | `--` for parenthetical |
| Minus sign (math) | `$-$` | `-` outside math mode |

### Space Errors

Search with regex for these patterns:

| Error | Correct | Regex |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Double space in text | Single space | `  +` (two or more spaces) |
| Missing space after period | `method. The` | `\.\w` |
| Space before comma | `method,` | ` ,` |
| No space after comma | `method, which` | `,[^ \\$~\n}]` |
| No space before `(` | `method (CMS)` | `\w\(` |

### Bracket Consistency

- All parentheses must be English `( )`, not Chinese `（ ）`
- Check for unmatched brackets
- Abbreviation pattern: full name + (ABBR) at first mention, then ABBR only

---

## Phase 4: Capitalization Consistency

### Section Titles

Check that ALL section/subsection titles follow ONE consistent style:

| Style | Example | Check |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Title Case | `\section{Related Work}` | First letter of major words capitalized |
| Sentence case | `\section{Related work}` | Only first word capitalized |
| ALL CAPS | `\section{EXPERIMENTS}` | Every letter capitalized |

**Error**: Mixing styles (e.g., "Related Work" + "EXPERIMENTS" + "method"). Pick one and apply consistently.

### Method/Model Names

- Consistency: same capitalization everywhere (e.g., "SBEAD" not "Sbead" or "sbead")
- First mention: full name + abbreviation
- After first mention: abbreviation only

### Acronyms

- Define every acronym at first use (including in the abstract separately from body)
- Never start a sentence with an undefined acronym
- Create a mental or explicit list of all acronyms; verify each is defined

---

## Phase 5: LaTeX-Specific Issues

### Non-Breaking Spaces Before Citations and References

```latex
% WRONG — line break may separate text from citation/reference
as shown in previous work \cite{smith2024}
as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:demo}
as shown in Table \ref{tab:results}

% CORRECT — non-breaking space prevents separation
as shown in previous work~\cite{smith2024}
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:demo}
as shown in Table~\ref{tab:results}
```

**Rule**: Always use `~` before `\cite{}`, `\ref{}`, `\eqref{}`.

Also check: `Table` or `Fig.` on one line with `\ref{}` on the next line → must be on same line with `~`.

### Citation at Sentence Beginning (Style-Dependent)

**For NUMBERED citation style** (`elsarticle-num`, `IEEEtran`):

```latex
% WRONG — renders as "[5] pioneered..."
\cite{lo2022graphsage} pioneered the application...

% CORRECT options for numbered style:
Lo et al.~\cite{lo2022graphsage} pioneered...     % Author + [number]
The work in~\cite{lo2022graphsage} pioneered...    % "work in [number]"
In~\cite{lo2022graphsage}, the authors pioneered...% "In [number],"

% WRONG — redundant construction
the work of Author et al.~\cite{key}, who employed... 
% "the work of Author [15], who" is awkward and redundant

% CORRECT
Author et al.~\cite{key} employed...
% OR
The work in~\cite{key} employed...
```

**For AUTHOR-YEAR style** (`elsarticle-harv`, `natbib`):

```latex
% Use \citet for textual citation at sentence start:
\citet{lo2022graphsage} pioneered...  % → "Lo et al. (2022) pioneered..."
```

### Redundant Formatting

Search for doubled commands:
```
\textbf{\textbf{...}}    → \textbf{...}
\textit{\textit{...}}    → \textit{...}
\emph{\emph{...}}        → \emph{...}
```

### Float Placement

- `[htbp]` is recommended for general use
- `[H]` (from float package) forces exact placement — use sparingly
- `[t]` is preferred for top-of-page figures in two-column layouts
- Check that ALL figures and tables have `\label` and are referenced in text

### Common LaTeX Errors

| Error | Fix |
|-------|-----|
| `\textit` for math variables | Use `$x$` not `\textit{x}` |
| Bare `%` in text | Use `\%` |
| Bare `_` in text | Use `\_` (e.g., `TON\_IoT`) |
| `\fontsize` without `\selectfont` | Always pair them |
| Missing `\label` after `\caption` | Add `\label` right after `\caption` |
| `\journal{}` still has template default | Change to target journal name |

---

## Phase 6: Grammar & Language Quality

### Contractions (Forbidden in Academic Writing)

```
don't → do not       can't → cannot        won't → will not
it's → it is         that's → that is      there's → there is
we've → we have      we're → we are        isn't → is not
```

### Duplicate Content Detection

Search for repeated phrases within the same paragraph or section:
- Repeated sentence openings within a paragraph
- Same phrase appearing twice in the same paragraph (e.g., "To formally define the problem... To formally define the problem...")
- Same idea restated in different words back-to-back

### Comma Splice Detection

A comma splice is two independent clauses joined only by a comma. Search for patterns like:
```
, When → . When  (or ; When)
, This → . This  (or ; This)  
, It   → . It    (or ; It)
, The  → . The   (if both clauses are complete sentences)
```

### Tense Consistency

| Section | Recommended Tense |
|---------|-------------------|
| Abstract | Past (what was done) + Present (what results show) |
| Introduction | Present (general facts) + Past (prior work) |
| Methods | Past (what was done) or Present (the algorithm does X) |
| Results | Past (experiments showed) |
| Discussion | Present (results suggest) + Future (future work will) |

### Redundant Phrases

| Verbose | Concise |
|---------|---------|
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| it can be seen that | (delete, start with the observation) |
| a large number of | many |
| in the case of | for / when |
| with respect to | for / regarding |
| on the other hand | however / alternatively |
| it is well-established that | (delete, state the fact directly) |
| it is important to note that | (delete, state the fact directly) |

### Common Grammar Errors in Non-Native English

| Error | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| "researches" (as plural noun) | "studies" or "research efforts" |
| "an anomaly detection" | "anomaly detection" (uncountable) |
| "datas" | "data" (already plural) |
| "informations" | "information" (uncountable) |
| "the Equation 1" | "Equation 1" or "Eq.~(1)" |
| "as shown in the Fig. 1" | "as shown in Fig.~1" |
| "in network environment" | "in the network environment" (missing article) |

---

## Phase 7: Tables, Figures & Numbers

### Tables

- Bold the best result in each column: `\textbf{0.9982}` — NOT double bold `\textbf{\textbf{...}}`
- Consistent decimal precision (e.g., all 4 decimal places in same table)
- Direction indicators: ↑ (higher is better), ↓ (lower is better)
- Use `booktabs` package (`\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`)
- Every table must be referenced in text

### Figures

- Vector format (PDF/EPS) for plots, not PNG/JPG
- Captions should be self-contained (understandable without reading main text)
- Font size in figures should be readable (not too small after scaling)
- Every figure must be referenced in text
- Consistent color scheme across all figures

### Number Cross-Reference Verification

**CRITICAL**: Verify that every number mentioned in the text matches its source:

- Numbers in abstract must match numbers in tables/results
- Dataset statistics in text (e.g., "4,554,344 communications") must match Table values
- Claimed improvements in text ("49 percentage points higher") must be verifiable from tables
- Model names and their associated numbers must be consistent

| Check | Example Error |
|-------|---------------|
| Text vs Table mismatch | Text says "4,554,343" but Table says "4,554,344" |
| Abstract vs Results mismatch | Abstract says "0.998 AUC" but table shows "0.9982" |
| Percentage claim errors | "49 percentage points" from 0.51 to 0.998 = 0.488, not 0.49 |

### Number Formatting Rules

| Rule | Wrong | Correct |
|------|-------|---------|
| Spell out numbers < 10 at sentence start | "4 datasets were used" | "Four datasets were used" |
| Numbers with units together | "5 %" | "5\%" |
| Thousands separator | "4554344" | "4,554,344" |
| Decimal consistency | "0.997" and "0.9984" | Same decimal places in same table |

### Table Performance Marking Verification Protocol

For every performance comparison table (main results, ablation, sensitivity analysis), systematically verify bold (best) and underline (second-best) markings:

**Step-by-step protocol:**

1. **Extract numerical values per column** — list all values for each metric column
2. **Rank values** — sort to identify true 1st (best) and 2nd (second-best)
3. **Cross-check markings** against actual ranking:
   - `\textbf{}` must be on the actual highest value (or lowest if lower-is-better)
   - `\underline{}` must be on the actual second-highest (or second-lowest)
4. **Verify every column independently** — a common error is ranking one column correctly but not another

**Tie handling:**
- Two values tied for best → both should be `\textbf{}`
- Two values tied for second-best → both should be `\underline{}`
- When best has a tie, the next distinct value is NOT second-best (it's third)

**Direction-aware columns:**
- Check for ↑ (higher-is-better) and ↓ (lower-is-better) indicators in headers
- Verify "best" means highest for ↑ metrics and lowest for ↓ metrics
- If no indicator, infer from metric semantics (F1↑, FPR↓, Latency↓, Parameters↓)

**Non-metric columns:**
- Columns that are deterministic properties of the configuration (e.g., "Parameter Count" as a function of hidden dimension, "Training Time" that scales deterministically) should generally NOT have bold/underline markings — they are reference information, not performance outcomes

**Common errors (ranked by frequency):**

| Error Type | Example | Fix |
|------------|---------|-----|
| Off-by-one ranking | Underline on 3rd-best, not 2nd-best | Re-rank all values in the column |
| Bold/underline swap | Best marked as underline, 2nd as bold | Swap the two markings |
| Direction confusion | Bolding highest parameter count when lower is better | Check ↑/↓ indicator and metric semantics |
| Missing tie handling | Only one of two identical best values bolded | Bold both tied values |
| Deterministic column marked | Parameter count bold/underlined | Remove markings from non-metric columns |
| Stale markings after data update | Values changed but markings not re-checked | Always re-verify after any data change |

## Phase 8: Content Structure & Completeness

### 8a. Abstract Quality

- [ ] Word count within journal limit (Elsevier: 150–300, IEEE: ≤200)
- [ ] Follows PRKS structure: Problem → Response → Key Results → Significance
- [ ] Problem section is ≤20% (not half the abstract)
- [ ] Contains specific numbers (AUC, improvement percentages, dataset names)
- [ ] No citations in abstract
- [ ] No undefined abbreviations (define in abstract even if defined in body)
- [ ] First sentence is NOT generic ("With the rapid development of...")
- [ ] Numbers in abstract match numbers in results tables

### 8b. Introduction Structure (CARS Model)

Verify the introduction follows the three-move structure:

- [ ] **Move 1 (Establish Territory)**: Field importance + key citations (1–2 paragraphs)
- [ ] **Move 2 (Establish Niche)**: Specific gap/limitation identified (1 paragraph)
- [ ] **Move 3 (Occupy Niche)**: "This paper proposes..." + contributions list + outline (1–2 paragraphs)
- [ ] Move 2 → Move 3 transition is natural (gap directly motivates the proposed method)
- [ ] Contributions: 3–5 numbered items, each specific and measurable
- [ ] Paper outline paragraph references all sections with `\ref{}`

### 8c. Paragraph & Sentence Structure

- [ ] No paragraphs >250 words (flag and suggest splitting)
- [ ] No single-sentence paragraphs (flag and suggest merging/expanding)
- [ ] Conclusion is multi-paragraph (not one giant block)
- [ ] No sentences >35 words (flag and suggest splitting)
- [ ] Sentence length varies naturally (not all the same length)

### 8d. Keywords

- [ ] Count: 4–6 (Elsevier) or 3–10 (IEEE)
- [ ] At least 1–2 keywords NOT from the title (for discoverability)
- [ ] Mix of broad (field) + specific (method/technique) terms
- [ ] No redundant keywords
- [ ] Standard terms used (not invented phrases)

### 8e. Section-Specific Structure

- [ ] **Related Work**: Organized thematically (not laundry list) + each theme has summary→limitations→citations + ends with gap summary paragraph that directly motivates the proposed method
- [ ] **Method**: All symbols defined at first use + notation table (if >10 symbols) + method overview figure + core intuition in plain language + algorithm pseudocode + design choice justifications + time/space complexity analysis
- [ ] **Experiments**: Baselines use published defaults (stated explicitly) + runs averaged with std + dataset statistics table + metrics mathematically defined + results interpreted (not just presented) + ablation study + fair comparison (same hardware, same splits, same parameters)
- [ ] **Discussion**: Result interpretation (not repetition) + comparison with ≥2 prior methods + mechanism explanation (WHY it works) + ≥3 specific limitations + broader implications
- [ ] **Limitations**: Present (in Discussion or Conclusion) — specific, not vague; each limitation names a concrete dataset, scenario, or parameter constraint
- [ ] **Conclusion**: Multi-paragraph (2–4) + strongest takeaway first + NOT a copy of the abstract + answers Introduction's research question + specific future work + no new information + no overclaiming

### 8f. Terminology Consistency

Pick one term and use throughout:

| Inconsistent | Pick One |
|-------------|----------|
| "anomaly detection" / "anomalous detection" / "AD" | Pick one form after definition |
| "graph stream" / "streaming graph" / "graph streams" | Pick one form |
| "dataset" / "data set" / "benchmark" | Be consistent |
| "TON_IoT" / "TON-IoT" / "TON\_IoT" | Match the original paper's name with `\_` in LaTeX |

### 8g. Cross-Section Consistency

- [ ] Abstract numbers = Table numbers
- [ ] Each numbered contribution maps to a specific section
- [ ] Introduction gap = Method solution
- [ ] Method symbols = Experiment parameters
- [ ] Conclusion claims ⊆ Results data

### 8h. Experimental Discussion Consistency

The Discussion/Analysis section of experiments is a frequent source of inconsistencies. Systematically verify:

**Ablation table vs. Discussion text grouping:**

When the ablation table organizes components into logical tiers or groups (e.g., "Cross-modal alignment", "Training strategy", "Model architecture"), verify that:

- [ ] The Discussion text references the SAME grouping as the table
- [ ] Each component is attributed to the CORRECT tier/group
- [ ] Delta values cited in text (e.g., "$\Delta$F1 = -3.67%") match the actual table data
- [ ] Component contribution descriptions match what the component actually does

| Error Type | Example | Impact |
|------------|---------|--------|
| Component miscategorized | Discussing "uncertainty-modulated loss" under "Model architecture" when it belongs under "Training strategy" | Misleads readers about design decisions |
| Delta value mismatch | Text says "$\Delta$F1 = -5.2%" but table shows -3.67% | Factual error; reviewer will catch |
| Contribution over-attribution | Claiming a component "contributes the largest gain" when another component has larger delta | Undermines credibility |

**Baseline description accuracy:**

- [ ] Each baseline's description matches its actual method (e.g., a method's acronym prefix meaning "Edge-feature" should not be described as "Efficient")
- [ ] Baseline evaluation scope differences are explicitly acknowledged (e.g., host-side methods evaluated at HBR granularity vs. session-level NFR methods)
- [ ] First-use acronym expansion is provided even in the experimental section (readers may jump directly to experiments)

**Discussion language rigor:**

- [ ] Causal claims are justified: "X caused improvement" only when ablation evidence supports it
- [ ] Comparative statements use correct grammar: "A与B均不同" not "A与B与C不同" (for Chinese); use parallel structure in English
- [ ] Hedging is appropriate: "suggests" vs "proves" vs "indicates" — matched to evidence strength

### Self-Citation Anonymization (for blind review)

- No author names in text if double-blind
- Replace "In our previous work [X]" with "In prior work [X]"
- Check PDF metadata (author field)

## Phase 9: BIB File & Reference Format Check

**The reference list is where reviewers frequently find careless errors. Studies show manuscripts with citation errors face 40% higher rejection rates.**

### 9a. Structural Integrity

Check every BIB entry for:

1. **Matching braces**: Every `@type{key,` must have a closing `}`
2. **No nested entries**: One entry must be fully closed before the next begins
3. **Required fields present**: `title`, `author`, `year` at minimum
4. **No trailing comma after last field** (some BibTeX implementations fail)

### 9b. Entry Type Correctness

Verify each entry uses the correct `@type` — Google Scholar and digital libraries frequently assign wrong types:

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Conference paper as `@article` | Change to `@inproceedings`, add `booktitle` |
| arXiv preprint as `@inproceedings` | Change to `@misc` with `eprint` field |
| Book chapter as `@inbook` | Verify: `@incollection` if different author from book |
| Entry has `booktitle` but is `@article` | Change to `@inproceedings` |
| Entry has `journal` but is `@inproceedings` | Change to `@article` |

### 9c. Author Name Format

| Check | Correct | Wrong |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Spaces between initials | `J. D. Owens` | `J.D. Owens` (BibTeX treats as single first name) |
| Hyphenated names braced | `Wu-{chun} Feng` | `Wu-chun Feng` (may split incorrectly) |
| Special characters escaped | `M{\"u}ller` | `Müller` (encoding error risk) |
| Names match published paper | Use what's printed on the paper | Don't normalize or abbreviate arbitrarily |

### 9d. Title Capitalization Protection

**CRITICAL**: Protect proper nouns, acronyms, method names, and dataset names with individual `{}` braces. NEVER double-brace the entire title.

| Must Protect | Examples | BibTeX Syntax |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Acronyms** | GPU, CNN, LSTM, IoT, CMS | `{GPU}`, `{CNN}`, `{LSTM}`, `{IoT}`, `{CMS}` |
| **Method/Model names** | BERT, ResNet, MIDAS, SBEAD, Adam | `{BERT}`, `{ResNet}`, `{MIDAS}`, `{SBEAD}` |
| **Dataset names** | ImageNet, CICIDS2017, DARPA, TON\_IoT | `{ImageNet}`, `{CICIDS2017}`, `{DARPA}` |
| **Proper nouns** | Gaussian, Bayesian, Markov, Fourier | `{G}aussian`, `{B}ayesian`, `{M}arkov` |
| **Tool names** | TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark, Hadoop | `{TensorFlow}`, `{PyTorch}` |

```
% WRONG — entire title double-braced (prevents ALL case conversion)
title = {{Efficient GPU Computing Using CUDA for Deep Learning}}

% WRONG — acronyms not protected (may become lowercase)
title = {Efficient GPU computing using CUDA for deep learning}

% CORRECT — individual protection
title = {Efficient {GPU} Computing Using {CUDA} for Deep Learning}
```

### 9e. Journal Name Consistency (Publisher-Dependent)

| Publisher | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **IEEE** | **Must abbreviate** per ISO 4 | `IEEE Trans. Knowl. Data Eng.` (NOT full name) |
| **Elsevier** | **Full name** | `Information Processing & Management` (NOT abbreviated) |
| **ACM** | **Full name** | `ACM Computing Surveys` (NOT abbreviated) |
| **Springer** | Check specific journal | Varies |

**Consistency rule**: ALL journal names in one bibliography must follow the SAME convention (all abbreviated OR all full). Never mix.

### 9f. Page Numbers, DOI, and Month

| Field | Correct | Wrong |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Pages | `pages = {35--49}` (en-dash) | `pages = {35-49}` (hyphen) |
| DOI | `doi = {10.1145/1234567}` (numbers only) | `doi = {https://doi.org/10.1145/1234567}` (full URL) |
| DOI + URL | Keep `doi` only, remove redundant `url` | Both `doi` and `url` pointing to same DOI |
| Month | `month = jun` (BibTeX macro, no quotes) | `month = {june}` or `month = {June}` |

**DOI display note**: `elsarticle-num.bst` does NOT render the `doi` field in output. Include it in .bib for your records, but it will not appear in the compiled PDF. ACM `acmart` REQUIRES DOI and does display it.

### 9g. Cross-Reference Check

- [ ] Every `\cite{key}` in .tex has a matching entry in .bib
- [ ] No "Citation undefined" warnings
- [ ] No duplicate citation keys in .bib
- [ ] Author names in text match BIB first author (e.g., "Lo et al." → BIB has `Lo` as first author)
- [ ] In-text `\cite{}` uses `~` non-breaking space before it
- [ ] Grouped citations sorted numerically: `\cite{a,b,c}` renders as [6, 8, 10] not [8, 6, 10]
- [ ] Digital library exports manually verified and corrected

### 9h. Reference Content Verification (Related Work Tables)

When the paper contains a comparison/summary table of related work methods, verify both existence and accuracy:

**Step 1: Verify paper existence** — For each cited paper, confirm via web search:

| Verification Method | Priority | When to Use |
|---------------------|----------|-------------|
| DOI resolution (doi.org/...) | Highest | When DOI is available |
| Google Scholar title search | High | Primary search method |
| DBLP / Semantic Scholar | High | Cross-verification |
| Publisher site (IEEE Xplore, ACM DL) | Medium | For publisher-specific papers |
| arXiv search | Medium | For preprints |

**Step 2: Verify bibliographic accuracy:**

- Author names match the actual published paper
- Venue/journal name is correct and complete
- Year matches the actual publication year
- Entry type (@article, @inproceedings, @inbook) matches the publication venue
- Vague author listings (e.g., "and others") should be replaced with complete author lists

**Step 3: Verify table summary accuracy** — For each paper's row in the comparison table:

| Field to Check | Verification Source | Common Error |
|----------------|--------------------|--------------| 
| Data Source | Paper abstract/experiments section | Overgeneralizing (e.g., "flow + packet" when paper only uses flows) |
| Core Technique | Paper abstract/method section | Mischaracterizing the technique (e.g., "Efficient X" when "E" stands for "Edge-feature") |
| Key Innovation | Paper abstract/contributions | Inventing innovations not claimed by the original authors |

**Red flags requiring immediate action:**

| Red Flag | Risk | Action |
|----------|------|--------|
| Paper not found in any database | May be fabricated or not yet published | Verify DOI; if unverifiable, flag to author |
| Author names don't match title | BIB entry may be wrong | Cross-check with publisher records |
| DOI resolves to different paper | Copy-paste error | Correct DOI |
| Table description contradicts paper abstract | Inaccurate summarization | Rewrite to match actual paper content |
| Very recent paper from small venue | May not be indexed yet | Not necessarily fake, but note verification difficulty |

**Example of common caught errors:**
- Table described a method's acronym prefix as "Efficient" → actual paper shows it stands for "Edge-feature" (misinterpreted abbreviation)
- Table listed a paper's author incorrectly → actual publisher record shows a different first author (auto-generated BIB entries are unreliable)

### 9i. Digital Library Export Verification

**NEVER trust auto-generated BibTeX** from Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, or DBLP:

| Source | Common Errors |
|--------|-------------|
| **Google Scholar** | Wrong entry type (conference → `@article`), missing fields, wrong capitalization |
| **IEEE Xplore** | Scrambled venue names, no spaces between initials, month as string, page format wrong |
| **ACM DL** | Title case wrong, DOI as full URL, redundant metadata fields |
| **DBLP** | Generally better, but still verify capitalization and entry type |
